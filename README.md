# Cube Dash Arena

Cube Dash Arena is a fast-paced multiplayer dodge game where two players control colorful cubes in a 3D arena. Players must avoid falling obstacles and survive as long as possible. The last cube standing wins the round.

## üîÑ ES Modules Architecture

This project uses ES modules for better code organization, maintainability, and modern JavaScript practices.

### Benefits of the ES Modules Architecture

- **Better Encapsulation**: Each module is responsible for its own functionality with clear boundaries
- **Explicit Dependencies**: You can see exactly what each module depends on
- **No Global State**: Eliminated all global variables, reducing potential bugs
- **Better Maintainability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
- **Modern JavaScript**: Following ES module best practices

### Game Flow

1. `index.html` redirects to `lobby.html` for player setup
2. After player setup, the game launches in `game.html`
3. `main.js` initializes the game components and modules
4. `gameManager.js` orchestrates the game loop and state management
5. `socketManager.js` handles multiplayer communication

---

## üîß Recent Code Refactoring

The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve quality and maintainability:

### Centralized Error Handling

- Created a new `utils.js` module with utility functions for error logging
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns across all modules
- Added fallback mechanisms for critical failures

### Removed Code Duplication

- Consolidated duplicate UI update logic in `socketManager.js`
- Removed redundant light setup methods in `scene.js`
- Eliminated duplicate level display methods in `difficulty.js`
- Standardized texture settings application in `textures.js`

### Improved Modularity

- Better separation of concerns between modules
- Reduced dependencies between components
- Enhanced code reusability with helper functions

### Documentation Updates

- Cleaned up README.md to reflect current implementation
- Removed duplicate sections and outdated information
- Added detailed comments to clarify complex logic

### Game Controls
- **‚Üê/‚Üí** or **A/D**: Move left/right
- **‚Üë** or **W** or **Space**: Jump

- Your project code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Sign up or log in to Render.com**
   - Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com) and create an account or log in

2. **Create a new Web Service**
   - Click on the "New +" button in the dashboard
   - Select "Web Service"

3. **Connect your repository**
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab account or use public repository URL
   - Select the cube-dash-arena repository

4. **Configure your service**
   - Name: `cube-dash-arena` (or any name you prefer)
   - Runtime: `Node`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node server/server.js`
   - Instance Type: Free (for testing) or Basic (for better performance)

5. **Deploy your application**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically deploy your application

6. **Access your deployed game**
   - Once deployment is complete, Render will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://cube-dash-arena.onrender.com`)
   - Share this URL with friends to play multiplayer

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues, check the Render logs in the dashboard
- For WebSocket connection problems, ensure your client is using the correct server URL
- If the game is slow, consider upgrading to a paid plan for better performance

### Maintenance

- Render automatically redeploys your application when you push changes to your repository
- You can manually trigger a deployment from the Render dashboard

## üîÑ Pushing Code to GitHub

To push your latest code changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\amiru\OneDrive\Desktop\cube-dash-arena
   ```

2. Add all changed files to staging:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Update: latest changes to Cube Dash Arena"
   ```

4. Push your changes to the main branch:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

5. Your changes will now be available on GitHub and will trigger automatic redeployment if you're using Render.com
